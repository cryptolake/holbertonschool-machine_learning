# Transfer Learning

For this project we are tasked in building our own model with transfer learning,
and train it on cifar-10 by choosing our own architecture and hyperparameters.

## My approach

I went with resnet-50 as it's very effecient and it's residual blocks that virtually
eliminates over-fitting, which is very important as our data is comparably smaller than
imagenet which was what resnet made for.
